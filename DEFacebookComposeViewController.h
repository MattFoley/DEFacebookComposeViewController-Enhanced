// SAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION + FLOW:
//
// -Create instance with initWithDelegate
// -When the view is created, this asks its delegate whether a FB session is open
// --If so, Post button is displayed
// --If not, Log In button is displayed
// -User presses Post or Log In: an activity indicator is shown and an appropriate delegate method is called
// -The object completing the Facebook operation should, upon completion of the operation, send the notification:
//    DEFacebookComposeViewControllerDelegateDidFinishFBOperation
//  to the default center. This signals the VC to update the view accordingly.
// (-If the user just logged in, they are presented with a Post button which allows them to post.)
//
